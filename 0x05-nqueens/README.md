# 0x05. N Queens Project

The "0x05. N queens" project is a computer science and mathematics challenge that employs the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This document provides all the necessary information and links to resources required for completing this project.

## Concepts Needed

### Backtracking Algorithms
- **Overview:** Learn how backtracking algorithms search for and build up solutions incrementally, abandoning solutions that fail to meet the constraints.
- [Backtracking Introduction](https://www.some-resource-url.com/backtracking-intro)

### Recursion
- **Overview:** Utilize recursion in Python to implement backtracking for the N queens problem.

### List Manipulations in Python
- **Overview:** Manipulate Python lists effectively to store the positions of queens.
- [Python Lists](https://www.some-resource-url.com/python-lists)

### Python Command Line Arguments
- **Overview:** Handle command-line arguments using the sys module in Python scripts.

## Requirements

- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** All scripts will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **Style:** Code should conform to PEP 8 style, version 1.7.*
- **Execution:** All files must be executable, with the first line being `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project directory.

## Tasks

### 0. N Queens
- **Objective:** Write a Python program that solves the N queens problem.
- **Usage:**
